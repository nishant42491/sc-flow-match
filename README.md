The code here implements Conditional Flow Matching for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Impputations. We follow the Independent Confitional Flow Matching Methodology proposed by Tong et al.

TO RUN THE CODE:

1> Set up an enviornment using virtualenv and install the required packages using !pip install virtualenv.

2> Place a Data Folder in the root directory. Place the dataset splits in the data folder in the .split_data section.
